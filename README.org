* Helm Bitbucket
A [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]] interface for searching Bitbucket.

** Installation
Download and install the =helm-bitbucket.el= file in your preferred way.

=helm-bitbucket= uses the credentials stored in =.authinfo.gpg= for
authenticating against the bitbucket API. So you need to add:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
machine api.bitbucket.org login <my-username> password <my-password> port https
#+END_EXAMPLE

to your =.authinfo.gpg= file.

If you are not familiar with =.authinfo=, check out
https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusAuthinfo for further information.

It is not currently possible to search across all Bitbucket repositories, so
=helm-bitbucket= searches all repositories for which your registered Bitbucket
user is a member. Thus, =helm-bitbucket= searches both your personal
repositories and the repositories of any Bitbucket team you are a member of.

** Usage
Run =M-x helm-bitbucket= and type a search string. (The search begins after
you've typed at least 2 characters).

Hitting =RET= with an item selected opens the corresponding repository in your
browser.
*** Keys
| =C-n=   | Next item.                       |
| =C-p=   | Previous item.                   |
| =RET=   | Open repository page in browser  |
| =C-h m= | Full list of keyboard shortcuts. |
